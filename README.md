# Boba Tracker

## Introduction

The Boba Tracker app serves the purpose of tracking the last time Boba, and later Jabba, were outdoors. It streamlines the process with minimal clicks, specifically tailored for users returning indoors to log entries on a Raspberry Pi screen. Initially created for a single dog, Boba, it later expanded to include Jabba. Originally designed for a Raspberry Pi with a 5-inch screen placed near the door, it now offers phone support, enabling users to log entries while on walks.

This application uses Firebase to store all data entries.
